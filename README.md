## Key Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered

- **Frontend Frameworks:** Next.js  
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS, CSS Modules  
- **Programming Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript  
- **Data & APIs:** GraphQL, REST API Integration  
- **System Design & Architecture:** Component-based design, scalable architecture  
- **Tools & Best Practices:** Git, GitHub, Code Reviews, Testing, Documentation  

### Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|---------|
| Understanding TypeScript types | Converted existing JavaScript projects to TypeScript, practiced defining types for components and API responses |
| Integrating GraphQL APIs | Used Apollo Client and followed official documentation to query and mutate data |
| Responsive design issues with TailwindCSS | Applied utility-first classes, custom breakpoints, and mobile-first design strategy |
| Coordinating frontend-backend work | Set up collaborative sessions with backend learners, shared API documentation, and tested endpoints together |

### Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Maintain a clean and organized component structure.  
- Write reusable and scalable code.  
- Document processes and code for easy collaboration.  
- Communicate frequently with team members to avoid integration issues.  
- Test early and often to prevent future bugs and improve reliability.
